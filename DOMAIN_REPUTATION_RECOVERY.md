# 🔧 Domain Reputation Recovery Plan

## Problem Identified
Gmail is marking emails as spam because: *"This message is similar to messages that were identified as spam in the past."*

**Root Cause:** Multiple test emails from localhost URLs damaged domain reputation.

## 🚨 Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Fix Environment Configuration ✅
- Changed `DOMAIN_URL` from `localhost:8080` to `https://thevectorcraft.com`
- This fixes broken tracking links in future emails

### 2. Domain Reputation Recovery Strategy

#### Phase 1: Stop the Damage (Immediate)
- ✅ Fixed localhost URLs  
- ✅ Improved email headers and content
- ✅ Technical spam score: 8.7/10

#### Phase 2: Reputation Recovery (1-2 weeks)
1. **Send fewer emails** - Start with minimal volume
2. **Ask recipients to "Report as Not Spam"** 
3. **Add to safe sender list** instructions
4. **Monitor delivery rates**

#### Phase 3: Alternative Solutions (If needed)

**Option A: Different From Address**
```env
FROM_EMAIL=vectorcraft.team@gmail.com
# Professional Gmail account with instant reputation
```

**Option B: Different Domain**
```env
FROM_EMAIL=hello@vectorcraft.app  
# Use subdomain or different domain
```

**Option C: Professional Email Service**
```env
# Use SendGrid, Mailgun, or Amazon SES
# These have established reputation
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Current Test Results:
- **Mail-tester.com:** 8.7/10 ✅ (Technical quality excellent)

```
