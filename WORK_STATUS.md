# VectorCraft Landing Page - Work Status

## Current Status
âœ… **Completed:**
- BentoGrid layout with 4 feature cards
- Magic UI Rainbow Button and Shiny Button in hero section
- Ripple effect for Line-tracing card
- Color palette animation for 64-color card
- Export format badges with sliding animations
- JavaScript AnimatedBeam class implementation

## Current Issue
ðŸ”§ **Magic UI Animated Beam - Not Working Properly**
- **File:** `/Users/ankish/Downloads/VC2/templates/landing_new.html`
- **Location:** AI Vectorization card (first card in BentoGrid)
- **Problem:** Animated beam gradient not flowing between input/output circles
- **Code Status:** JavaScript AnimatedBeam class implemented but animation not visible

## Next Tasks
1. **Fix Animated Beam Animation**
   - Debug SVG gradient animation
   - Check path calculation between circles
   - Verify animateTransform is working
   - Test with simpler animation first

2. **Enhance Other Cards**
   - Consider adding more Magic UI effects to remaining cards
   - Improve hover states and transitions

3. **Overall Landing Page**
   - Test all animations work smoothly
   - Optimize performance
   - Ensure responsive design works

## Files Modified
- `templates/landing_new.html` - Main landing page with BentoGrid
- All changes committed to GitHub (commit: 053d73b)

## Priority
**HIGH:** Fix Animated Beam - this is the key Magic UI component that should showcase the AI processing flow from raster to vector.
