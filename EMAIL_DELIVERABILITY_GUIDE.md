# üìß Email Deliverability Guide for VectorCraft

## Current Issue: Emails Going to Spam

Your emails are being flagged as spam. This guide provides immediate fixes and long-term solutions.

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Enhanced Email Headers
- Added proper `From` header with display name: "VectorCraft Support <support@thevectorcraft.com>"
- Added `Reply-To`, `Message-ID`, `Date` headers
- Added anti-spam headers: `X-Mailer`, `X-Priority`, `Importance`
- Proper MIME content type headers

### 2. Improved Email Content
- **Less promotional language**: Removed excessive marketing terms
- **Professional tone**: More business-like, less salesy
- **Better subject line**: "Your VectorCraft Account is Ready" (instead of "Login Credentials")
- **Proper HTML structure**: Valid HTML5 with viewport meta tags
- **Text/HTML balance**: Both versions with similar content

## üîß ADDITIONAL FIXES NEEDED

### 3. Domain Configuration (Critical)
**Current Issue**: Emails from `support@thevectorcraft.com` without proper DNS records

**Required DNS Records for thevectorcraft.com:**

```dns
# SPF Record (TXT)
v=spf1 include:secureserver.net include:_spf.godaddy.com ~all

# DKIM Record (TXT) - Get from GoDaddy
# You need to generate this in your GoDaddy email settings
selector._domainkey.thevectorcraft.com TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"

# DMARC Record (TXT)
_dmarc.thevectorcraft.com TXT "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@thevectorcraft.com"

# MX Records (if using GoDaddy email)
thevectorcraft.com MX 10 smtp.secureserver.net
thevectorcraft.com MX 0 mailstore1.secureserver.net
```

### 4. GoDaddy Email Setup
1. **Verify Domain Ownership** in GoDaddy email settings
2. **Enable DKIM signing** in GoDaddy control panel
3. **Set up proper MX records** if not already done
4. **Verify SPF record** includes GoDaddy servers

### 5. Content Improvements

**Remove Spam Trigger Words:**
- Avoid: "FREE", "UNLIMITED", "LIFETIME", "AMAZING", "INCREDIBLE"
- Use: "included", "access", "subscription", "features", "tools"

**Better Subject Lines:**
```
‚ùå "Welcome to VectorCraft - Your Login Credentials" (spammy)
‚úÖ "Your VectorCraft Account is Ready" (professional)
‚úÖ "VectorCraft Access Details" (simple)
‚úÖ "Account Setup Complete" (neutral)
```

### 6. SMTP Authentication
**Current Setup**: GoDaddy SMTP with TLS
**Verify Settings:**
```
Server: smtpout.secureserver.net
Port: 587 (STARTTLS)
Username: support@thevectorcraft.com
Password: [Your GoDaddy password]
```
